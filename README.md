Learn how to prevent rear-end collisions on motorways using calliope mini

## Contents
A bordcomputer knows the current speed of a vehicle. The nav knows if the car is on a motorway and the direction it is heading. And computers can talk to each other. So why don't they warn each other in case of a traffic jam on a motorway? Let's change thhis and learn how to build a crash warner.

## What you need
You will need two ore more Calliope Mini so that they can communicate. And maybe some toy cars for testing.

## How to use
Go to MakeCode to view the code, make changes and make it even better. Maybe in addition to the warning tone, you want to slow down the cars.
